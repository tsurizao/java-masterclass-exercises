# java-masterclass-exercises, where to find the code
This is a repository for all Java work and exercises completed prior to enrollment with Codeup and also prior to registering an account with Github.  The course was from Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17 by Tim Buchalka of Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy.  The course can be found here https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/

1.  Some files are not direct exercise solutions but were used for practicing Java, logic concepts and/or following along with the instructor.
2.  All actual Java coding exercises were solved by me with the exception of the DiagonalStar program.
3.  A lot of the smaller exercises were combined together into two larger files.  These are named 'ChallengeSolutions' and 'ChallengeSolutionsTwo'.

- NOTE - 
ALL of the Java work can be found in the java-masterclass-exercises "recovery" branch, then Java-Masterclass-Exercises, then the "src" directory.

# java-masterclass-exercises
This is a repository for all Java work and exercises completed prior to enrollment with Codeup.

1.  Some files are not direct exercise solutions but were used for practicing Java concepts
2.  All actual Java coding exercises were solved by me with the exception of the DiagonalStar program.  
3.  A lot of the smaller exercises were combined together into two larger files.  These are named 'ChallengeSolutions' and 'ChallengeSolutionsTwo'.
4.  All of the work can be found in the java-masterclass-exercises 'recovery' branch.

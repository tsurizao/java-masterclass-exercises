# java-masterclass-exercises, where to find the code
This is a repository for all Java work and exercises completed prior to enrollment with Codeup.
The course was from Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17 by Tim Buchalka of Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy.
This is located at https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/

1.  Some files are not direct exercise solutions but were used for practicing Java concepts and/or following along with the instructor.
2.  All actual Java coding exercises were solved by me with the exception of the DiagonalStar program.
3.  A lot of the smaller exercises were combined together into two larger files.  These are named 'ChallengeSolutions' and 'ChallengeSolutionsTwo'.
4.  All of the Java work can be found in the java-masterclass-exercises "recovery" branch, then Java-Masterclass-Exercises, then the "src" directory.

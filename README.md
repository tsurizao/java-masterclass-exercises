# java-masterclass-exercises
This is a repository for all work and exercises completed prior to enrollment with Codeup.

1.  Some files are not direct exercise solutions but were used for practicing Java concepts
2.  All exercise code that is present was solved by me.
3.  I combined a lot of exercises together into one larger files.  Not all were modified in this way, but it was done to practice moving code around.
